	<h1>The Chat App Terms of Service</h1>
	<hr>
	By using <i>TheChatApp,</i> you agree to the following conditions:
	<ol>
		<li><b>Spamming</b> - Spamming is not tolorated in <i>TheChatApp</i>, as it invokes a feeling of annoyance in other fellow users. It disrupts friendly conversations, might crash someone's computer, and some other nasty stuff. There will be consequences to spamming.</li>
		<li><b>Only one account at a time</b></li>
		<li><b>Oblige people asking you to stop.</b> - When someone asks you to stop, you are expected to stop. Of course, only stop if there is a resonable reason behind it (e.g. stop spamming, stop inappropriate behavior, etc.).</li>
		<li><b>No Abusing Privileges</b> - As an Admin, there are special privileges, like getting to use powerful commands that normal users don't. Commands like <code>/sudo</code> can be unimaginably powerful. Taking the example of <code>/sudo</code>, it can make users say something while the admin using it gets away without a trace. These commands can be dangroues in the wrong hands: they can get innocent users kicked for something they did not do. Therefore, it is of utter importance to us that you admins <u>DO NOT</u> abuse the commands and privileges we gifted to you. If you for some reason do so, we will promptly demote you.</li>
		<li><b>No Swearing</b> - We want <i>TheChatApp</i> to be a safe and friendly environment. You can annihilate that by using profanities. Therefore, we do not tolorate any amount of profanity. Even the tinest of offence may lead to a kick</li>
		<li><b>No impersonation</b> - Once again, we want <i>TheChatApp</i> to be a safe and friendly environment. One of the last things we would want to do is to accuse an innocent user.</li>
	</ol>
    <!--<h1>No Spamming, Only 1 account. If someone tells you to stop, then stop. For admins, no abusing commands. Use wisely. No swearing or impersonation. Any breaking of rules will result in a kick.</h1> ALSO cool thing devs can probably ban people but i will work on that soon(grab ip ban ip)-->
